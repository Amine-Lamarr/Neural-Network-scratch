# ðŸš€ aminecanfly Neural Network

A custom-built feedforward neural network with two hidden layers using ReLU and Sigmoid â€” written fully from scratch in Python with NumPy. matplotlib , seaborn for visualization.

What It Does

- Builds a 3-layer neural network:
- Input â†’ ReLU â†’ ReLU â†’ Sigmoid
- Trains using **backpropagation** + **binary cross-entropy**
- Handles predictions, loss tracking, and plotting
- Visualizes:
  - Loss over epochs
  - Confusion matrix
- Evaluates:
  - Accuracy
  - Recall

Tech Stack

- `Python`
- `NumPy`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
